VivlioCrawler
=============
It parses all the entries of vivliothmmy.ee.auth.gr and captures all their data in a JSON file. 
Vivliothmmy is an OAI (Open Archives Initiative) library and all the undergraduate theses of the students of
Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Aristotle University used to be stored there.
Due to migration to newer system all the data needed to be captured in an efficient way.
